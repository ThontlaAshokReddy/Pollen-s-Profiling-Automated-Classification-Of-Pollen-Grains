  <h1>Pollen Grain Project</h1>
  <h4>1.Introduction</h4>
<p>Pollen grains are tiny reproductive structures produced by seed plants.
     They contain the male gametes (sperm cells) necessary for fertilizing the 
     female ovules during plant reproduction. Pollen grains have unique shapes and
      surface patterns specific to each plant species, which helps in their
 identification. They play a crucial role in pollination, enabling plants to 
 reproduce and maintain biodiversity.

  <h2>2. Structure of a Pollen Grain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exine</strong> – Tough outer shell (protects)</li>
    <li><strong>Intine</strong> – Inner soft layer</li>
    <li><strong>Tube Cell</strong> – Grows a tube to deliver sperm</li>
    <li><strong>Generative Cell</strong> – Divides into 2 sperm cells</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Types of Pollination</h1>
  <pollination><ul>1.Self-Pollination</ul></pollination>
  <p> Self-pollination is the process in which pollen from the anther (male part) of a flower is transferred to the stigma (female part) of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. This type of pollination does not require external agents like wind, water, or insects.

Types of Self-Pollination:

Autogamy – Pollen is transferred within the same flower.<br>

Geitonogamy – Pollen is transferred between different flowers on the same plant.<br>
</p>
    
<Cross-Pollination>Cross-Pollination</Cross-Pollination>
<p>Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower on a different plant of the same species. It usually involves the help of external agents like wind, insects, birds, or water. This method promotes genetic diversity, resulting in stronger and healthier plants. However, it depends on pollinators and environmental conditions.
