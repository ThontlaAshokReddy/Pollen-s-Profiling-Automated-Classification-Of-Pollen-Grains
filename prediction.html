<h2>Prediction</h2>
<p>I predict that pollen grains from different plants will have varied shapes, sizes, and surface textures based on how they are pollinated.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pollen from <strong>insect-pollinated plants</strong> (like sunflowers) will be <em>larger, spiky, and sticky</em> to attach to insects.</li>
  <li>Pollen from <strong>wind-pollinated plants</strong> (like grasses or maize) will be <em>smaller, smooth, and light</em> to travel in the air.</li>
</ul>

<p>This prediction is based on the idea that plant species adapt their pollen structures to their pollination methods.</p>
